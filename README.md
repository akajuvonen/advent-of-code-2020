# advent-of-code-2020-clojure
Advent of Code 2020 solutions in Clojure.

The idea is to pick and choose the days that seem interesting and could teach me something new about Clojure without taking excessive amount of time. I don't plan on completing every day.

## Running

The project uses leiningen, so just type `lein run` followed by the day and part (1 or 2) and the output will be printed, e.g.,

```
lein run 1 2
> Day 1, part 2:
> 123456
```

## Breakdown

TODO: more details and design choices for each completed day, plus other relevant comments and notes.
